AoDDS.py - Python wrapper for native DDS texture building

Provides high-performance DDS generation that bypasses Python's GIL
by delegating the entire build pipeline to native C code:
- Cache reading + JPEG decoding + image composition
- Mipmap generation + DXT compression
- All in a single native call

Usage:
    from autoortho.aopipeline import AoDDS
    
    # Build a complete DDS tile from cached JPEGs
    dds_bytes = AoDDS.build_tile_native(
        cache_dir="/path/to/cache",
        row=1234, col=5678,
        maptype="BI", zoom=16,
        chunks_per_side=16,
        format="BC1"
    )

class DDSBufferPool:
    """
    Thread-safe pool of reusable numpy buffers for DDS building with priority queue.
    
    Eliminates per-call allocation overhead (~15ms) and avoids copying
    data back to Python (~65ms) by reusing pre-allocated numpy arrays.
    
    Priority Queue ("Bank Queue") System:
    - Live tiles (PRIORITY_LIVE=0): Premium clients, served first
    - Prefetch tiles (PRIORITY_PREFETCH=100): Low priority, served when idle
    
    When all buffers are in use, waiters are queued by priority. When a buffer
    is released, the highest-priority (lowest number) waiter is served first.
    This ensures live tiles are never blocked by prefetch work.

    QUALITY OPTIMIZATION:
    Instead of building mipmap 0 and deriving smaller mipmaps via reduce_half,
    this function builds EACH mipmap from its native zoom level's JPEG chunks:
    - Mipmap 0: ZL16 chunks (256 chunks, 4096x4096)
    - Mipmap 1: ZL15 chunks (64 chunks, 2048x2048)

    - Mipmap 4: ZL12 chunks (1 chunk, 256x256)
    
    FALLBACK:
    If a zoom level has no chunks (all None/empty), falls back to reduce_half

    network failures gracefully.

    Build DDS from cache files and write directly to disk (NATIVE ZERO-COPY).
    
    This is the OPTIMAL path for NATIVE MODE predictive DDS caching:
    - C reads cache files directly
    - C decodes + compresses in parallel
    - C writes directly to disk (no Python involvement)
    - Perfect integration with EphemeralDDSCache
    
    This provides the same optimization as build_from_jpegs_to_file() but for
    native mode where C handles file I/O.
    
    Performance improvement over build_tile_native():
    - ~65ms copy overhead eliminated (no buffer → bytes conversion)
    - Streaming write (lower peak memory)
    
    Atomicity:
    - Uses temp file + rename pattern
    - No corrupt files on crash
    
    Args:
        cache_dir: Directory containing cached JPEGs
        row: Tile row coordinate
        col: Tile column coordinate
        maptype: Map source identifier (e.g., "BI", "EOX")
        zoom: Zoom level for chunk fetching
        output_path: Path to output DDS file
        chunks_per_side: Number of chunks per side (default 16)
        format: Compression format - "BC1" (DXT1) or "BC3" (DXT5)
        missing_color: RGB tuple for missing chunks
        decode_pool: Optional decode buffer pool handle from AoDecode
    
    Returns:
        FileBuildResult with success status and metadata.
    
    Example:
        result = build_tile_to_file(
            cache_dir="/path/to/cache",
            row=1234, col=5678,
