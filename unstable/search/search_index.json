In the install directory of X-Plane there will be a <code>Custom Scenery</code> folder.  Under this folder there will be a number of sub directories of scenery and a <code>scenery_packs.ini</code> configuration file.  This is where X-Plane will look for scenery.</p> <p>Under each scenery subdirectory, there will be an <code>Earth Nav Data</code> directory that contains a number of lat-lon named subdirectories.  Under these subdirectories will be a number of DSF files that contain instructions for X-Plane for this set of coordinates.</p> <p>These DSF files are picked up by X-Plane based on the area that you are flying.  During flight initialization a set of these files around your takeoff location are loaded.  While flying new DSF files will be loaded.  This loading while flying happens asynchronously behind the scenes.</p> <p>The DSF files can contain various instructions for X-Plane.  What we are interested in for orthophotos are terrain files.  The terrain files a DSF contains would then point to the textures requested for this terrain, including satellite photo textures.  These files are typically <code>.dds</code> files, though that's not always the case.</p> <p>DDS files can contain multiple copies of the same texture at reduced resolutions.  These are referred to as 'mipmaps'.  This allows X-Plane to just pull in the minimum amount of data that is required into memory at any given time.  Typically the maximum resolution for a texture is only required while flying low and for close by tetxures.</p>"},{"location":"details/#how-this-project-leverages-this-setup-high-level-description","title":"How this project leverages this setup (high level description)","text":"<p>This project effectively requires all the parts of normal orthophoto satellite imagery, except for the satellite photos themselves.</p> <p>Existing mechanisms to create and manage DSF files, and related terrain files, still applies.

When X-Plane attempts to read a specific mipmap of a texture this program will pull down just the minimum required data and return this data to X-Plane. This happens behind the scenes and as far as X-Plane is concerned, it is continuing to read a normal filesystem.</p> <p>Since we only download the minimum required data, this process is relatively efficient.</p> <p>Data is cached in memory until a memory limit is reached, at which time older data will be purged.</p>"},{"location":"details/#expert-usage-and-overriding-defaults","title":"Expert Usage and Overriding Defaults","text":""},{"location":"details/#warning","title":"Warning","text":"<p>I highly recommend using the pre-packaged scenery packs provided with this tool.  </p> <p>However, it's entirely possible to use your own scenery, if you wish.
